// graphify OpenCode plugin, adapted from `graphify opencode install`.

// session. The command itself is never modified, so the plugin behaves the same under any shell
// OpenCode uses (bash, zsh, Windows PowerShell 5.1, PowerShell 7) and cannot change what runs.
// Rerunning `graphify opencode install` restores upstream's command-prefixing version; keep this one.
