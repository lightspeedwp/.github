<!-- BADGES-END -->

Use this workflow when converting a Tour Operator finding, audit gap, QA failure, content-model problem, schema risk, Gravity Forms issue, Wetu sync risk, or block-theme implementation task into a developer-ready issue draft.

## Routing rules

- Use an issue draft when the next action needs development, configuration, QA retest, repo work, or clear ownership.
- Use a client-safe summary instead when the user needs stakeholder communication rather than execution detail.
- Use a finding register when there are many findings and issue splitting is not yet clear.
- Do not create live issues unless the user explicitly asks and the relevant tool is available.

## Evidence requirements

Every issue draft must include:

1. Confirmed evidence source.
2. Affected environment.
3. Affected content type or workflow.
4. Expected behaviour.
5. Actual behaviour or gap.
6. Risk if left unresolved.
7. Acceptance criteria.
8. Verification steps.
9. Unknowns or blockers.

## Split rules

Split issues when any of these are true:

- Different owners are likely required: content, design, development, SEO, forms, hosting, or client.
- A high-risk production change is mixed with a low-risk content update.
- A .schemas/readiness task is mixed with implementation work.
- Core content-model work is mixed with extension-specific work.
- Wetu import/sync work is mixed with manual WordPress content cleanup.

Keep one issue when:

- The fix is atomic.
- The same evidence, owner, and verification path apply.
- Splitting would create admin overhead without reducing risk.

## Suggested label groups

Use labels only as suggestions unless the connected tracker has confirmed labels.

- Area: `tour-operator`, `content-model`, `gravity-forms`, `yoast`, `schema`, `block-theme`, `wetu`, `qa`, `launch`
- Risk: `risk-low`, `risk-medium`, `risk-high`
- Type: `bug`, `enhancement`, `audit-finding`, `implementation`, `content`, `technical-seo`, `accessibility`
- Source confidence: `confirmed-live`, `confirmed-repo`, `confirmed-source-file`, `needs-verification`

## Output

Use `references/outputs/issue-draft-templates.md` for GitHub/Linear-style issue drafts. Keep client-safe wording separate from internal notes.
