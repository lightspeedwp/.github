<!-- BADGES-END -->

Update all README files in this agent’s attached file tree so they accurately match the latest attached file and folder structure, then run the relevant validation checks.

This is a maintenance implementation task. Do not just review. Make the edits and run the checks.

## Scope

- Update every attached README-style file you can find, including at least:
  - `tests/README.md`
  - `scripts/README.md`
  - `schemas/README.md`
  - `references/README.md`
- Also update any other attached README or README-like file if it exists and is stale.

## Source of truth

- Use the current attached file tree as the only source of truth for file and folder structure.
- Use the current attached skill set and current instruction routing as the source of truth for any README text that mentions routing, validation ownership, specialist handoff, launch-readiness review, or audit preparation.

## Current attached specialist skills to align with

- `site-preflight`
- `pre-launch-readiness-review`
- `yoast-configuration`
- `yoast-auditor`
- `gravity-forms-configuration`
- `gravity-forms-auditor`
- `wordpress-accessibility-checker`
- `agent-asset-validation-maintainer`

## README update requirements

- Inspect the current attached file tree first.
- Update each README so its:
  - file inventories
  - folder inventories
  - path references
  - validation references
  - workflow notes
  - maintenance notes
  accurately reflect the current attached structure.
- Remove stale references to files, folders, scripts, schemas, templates, examples, tests, references, workflows, or validation assets that no longer exist.
- Add references to newly present files or folders when relevant to that README’s purpose.
- Preserve each README’s existing role and scope unless a small wording fix is needed for accuracy.
- Keep edits surgical, not expansive.
- Use exact current paths.
- Use UK English.

## Skill and routing anti-drift rules

- Do not leave README text that implies dependence on:
  - workspace-only skills
  - shared directory skills
  - removed skills
  - stale old skill names
  - generic unattached `wordpress-*` skill references
- If a README mentions routing, launch-readiness, audit preparation, specialist review, or validation ownership, align it with the currently attached skills and current instruction logic.
- Do not present an unattached Tour Operator specialist skill as part of the current attached route inventory.

## Validation alignment rules

- Keep README references aligned with the current attached validation assets in:
  - `tests/`
  - `scripts/`
  - `schemas/`
  - `references/`
- Where relevant, align with:
  - `tests/skill-routing-snapshot.md`
  - `tests/instruction-file-consistency-source.md`
  - current validation scripts
  - current schema files
  - current reference standards

After editing, run the relevant validation checks for the updated README and documentation state. At minimum, run the validation checks that verify:

- instruction/file consistency
- folder/schema consistency where relevant
- agent structure or documentation consistency if applicable

If a validation script fails because a referenced file is not staged locally first, stage the needed attached files and rerun the check.

## Deliverables

1. Update all affected README files.
2. Run the relevant validation checks.
3. Report:
   - which README files were changed
   - stale references removed
   - new structure references added
   - which validation checks were run
   - whether they passed or failed
   - any remaining ambiguities caused by truncated file visibility or unclear ownership
4. Flag any non-README documentation that still appears stale, but do not rewrite it unless needed for README consistency.

## Editing standard

- Be surgical, not expansive.
- Prefer precise corrections over broad rewrites.
- Do not invent missing files, folders, workflows, or capabilities.
- Keep the final README set coherent and internally consistent.
