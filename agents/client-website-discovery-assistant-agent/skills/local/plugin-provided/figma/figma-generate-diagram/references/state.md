<!-- BADGES-END -->

Use this reference for **state diagrams** — the states of a single entity or system and the transitions between them. Think: an order moving from Pending → Paid → Shipped → Delivered, a user account through Active / Suspended / Deleted, a TCP connection, a deploy pipeline, a state machine of any kind.

If the subject is **interactions between multiple parties over time**, use a sequence diagram instead. If it's a **decision tree with branches but no real state concept**, use a flowchart.
