Use this reference for **gantt charts** — project timelines, roadmaps, phased work, sprint plans, launch calendars, anything where the primary dimension is time and items have a start, duration, and optionally a dependency on other items.

If the user wants an abstract dependency graph (A depends on B) without specific dates, use a **flowchart** instead. Gantt is for time-on-an-axis.
