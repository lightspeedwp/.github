# **0) System overview** {#0-system-overview}
- **Projects** — cross-repo planning/tracking  
- **Issue Types** — classification (Bug / Feature / Task / …)  
- **Labels** — routing signals (priority, status, area, compatibility, environment)  
- **Milestones** — release trains/timeboxes  
- Themes/Initiatives → Epics → Stories (Stories mainly first-pass scoping before splitting into implementable work).  
- Flow: Backlog → Ready/Todo → In progress → In review → In QA → Done

# **1) Core principles** {#1-core-principles}
Small, consistent model; field-first Projects (Status, Priority, Area, Theme, Iteration/Milestone); standardised names/casing; DoR/DoD; automation; focus on customer outcomes.

# **2) Naming conventions** {#2-naming-conventions}
Issue Types in Title Case; labels as `family:value` (kebab-case).

# **3) How we use issues (hierarchy)** {#3-how-we-use-issues-hierarchy}
(unchanged)

# **4) Scrumban workflow (applies to projects)** {#4-scrumban-workflow}
(unchanged)

# **5) Project setup — standard configuration** {#5-project-setup--standard-configuration}
(unchanged)

# **6) Governance & migration** {#6-governance--migration}
Maintain Issue Types, labels and palette centrally; migrate legacy `type:*` labels to Issue Types; keep a single field registry; monthly hygiene review.

# **7) Colour systems (Issue Types and Labels)** {#7-colour-systems-issue-types-and-labels}
- Org Issue Types & Labels live in the dedicated guides/tabs.  
- Labels exclude `type:*` (Issue Types cover classification).  
- Palette cheat-sheet and rationale retained.
