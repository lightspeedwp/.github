# LightSpeed Default Community Health Files

> Adds community files to repos that haven't setup their own.

## Overview

GitHub supports [organization-wide community health files](https://github.blog/changelog/2019-02-21-organization-wide-community-health-files/) in a specially named `.github` repository to serve as organization-wide defaults for all repositories within their organization.  Where sensible, custom community health files should be created for our repos, but that's not always necessary or practical.

The following are the default `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATES`, and `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` files for LightSpeed repositories that do not have custom ones themselves.  Note that these default files won’t appear in the file browser or Git history for each repository, but they will be surfaced throughout developers’ workflows, such as when opening a new issue or when viewing the Community Profile, just as if it were committed to the repository directly.
